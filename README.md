## For TEA Lab's members to review the scripts and files they may need to do development.

Find models and scripts in DonkeyModels folder. 

## The DonkeyModels folder contains two directories. 

OldLarsen has the files we used to use in the old lab. The files inside apply to the original cardboard track environment

Mala is the model and script file that we are currently using for development.

## Modify instructions

If you want to make changes to the project, create the folder that belongs to your own/group project first and then add the files. Just create it directly on the main branch (DonkeyCar-TEA), unless you want to add some files to an existing model/script library. 

Also remember to add your comments.
